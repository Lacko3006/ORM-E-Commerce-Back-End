# ORM Project

## Description
This project was to create routes to send data to the back end and allow us to update, delete and add to the backend.
The web app demonstrates the ability to use a JavaScript, Node.js & Sequileze.
This project was created because it is good practise on how to get the front end to talk to the backend when transferring data.
